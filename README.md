# portfolio
This portfolio is built on Bootstrap 3 and has a small amount of PHP in it, so you'll need something like MAMP to get it to run correctly 
locally.

I made some pretty huge changes before pushing it to Github originally. You can probably checkout one of the initial commits and see how
the site used to look.
